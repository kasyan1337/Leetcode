# Daily LeetCode Challenges ðŸš€

This repository stores my daily LeetCode challenges, organized by difficulty level and by my previous work done in China. Each solution includes the task description, the Python solution, and additional organization features to help with my progress.

## Structure ðŸ“‚


- **China/**: Contains problems I solved while I was in China. The subfolders inside (`Easy`, `Medium`, and `Hard`) represent the difficulty levels of the problems solved during that time.
- **Easy/**, **Medium/**, **Hard/**: After returning, I organized the new challenges by their difficulty level, with each folder containing solutions to problems from LeetCode.
- **ensure_files.py**: A script to automatically ensure each folder contains the appropriate files for `solution.py`, `task.md`, and other required files.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the dependencies and libraries required for running the solutions (if applicable).
- **readme.md**: This file.

Each folder for individual problems contains:
- `solution.py`: The Python script that contains the solution to the problem.
- `task.md`: A markdown file containing the description of the problem.

> **Note:** There are invisible notes for personal use in some folders that are not mentioned here, as they are for my reference only.
